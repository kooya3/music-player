# âœ¨Project Musiqâœ¨ðŸš€

Introducing my new web app that will revolutionize the way you listen to music. I built this app using the latest technologies including ReactJS, Redux, and Tailwind, to create a sleek and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.

My app not only provides a search functionality to find your favorite songs, but it also utilizes the Shazam API to offer an extensive list of related songs by your favorite artists. You can easily access top charts from around the world and discover new music from different regions.

In addition, I've added a unique feature that utilizes geolocation API to identify the music popular in your location. With this feature, you can easily discover new music from your local region and stay up-to-date with the latest trends.

I understand that building such a sophisticated app was no easy feat, but I worked tirelessly to minimize errors and bugs, ensuring that my app runs smoothly and efficiently. With your support, I hope to continue improving and expanding my app to provide the best music listening experience possible.

I welcome contributions and sponsorships from anyone who shares my passion for music and technology. So, come join me and experience the coolest music app ever created!ðŸ”¥

## Pull Request

There are 2 main work flows when dealing with pull requests:

* Pull Request from a [forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* Pull Request from a branch within a repository

Here we are going to focus on 2. Creating a Topical Branch:


1. First, we will need to create a branch from the latest commit on master. Make sure your repository is up to date first using

   ```bash
    git pull origin main
   ```

   *Note:* `git pull` does a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge` to update the local repo with the remote repo. For a more detailed explanation, see [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/whats-the-difference-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch).

2. To create a branch, use `git checkout -b <new-branch-name> [<base-branch-name>]`, where `base-branch-name` is optional and defaults to `main`. 
   
   Use a standard convention for branch names. For example, `<your-name>-dev`. It will be easier to track your pull requests if you use this convention.
   
   I'm going to create a new branch called `jsm-dev` from the `main` branch and push it to github.

   ```bash
    git checkout -b jsm-dev main
    git push origin jsm-dev
   ```

3. To create a pull request, you must have changes committed to your new branch.

4. Go to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/JavaScript-Mastery-PRO/project1_team4_repository/pulls) and click on the `New Pull Request` button.

5. Select the `main` branch as the `base` branch and the `jsm-dev` branch as the `compare` branch.

6. Follow the template and fill in the proper information for the pull request.

7. Click on the `Submit` button.

8. You have successfully created a pull request. Now wait for mentor approval. Once approved, you can merge the pull request.
